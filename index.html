                    Once upon a time in 1996 we opened a small café and roastery.
                    After many years of serving our fine coffees from around the world...
                    we grew out of our small space and we realized we needed more room
                    with which to bake, and cook and serve our many loyal and new customers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After a few diversions, illusions and contusions, we acquired our larger
                    space on the corner of Wilson Creek Plaza. Our café features all the
                    coffees that we roast. We serve amazing fresh, made to order food, and
                    delicious baked goods, made from scratch.
